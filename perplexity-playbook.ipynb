    "Perplexity is an intelligent search engine with a chatbot sytle interface that leverages popular AI models to offer comprehensive answers to user inquiries.  It is able to search the internet to provide real-time information via a friendly user experience that includes native mobile apps.  The tool is specifically designed to perform as a research companion providing links to underlying source articles unlike ChatGPT in default mode.  Perplexity comes with an OpenAI-compliant API called [`pplx-api`](https://blog.perplexity.ai/blog/introducing-pplx-api) which was introduced in October 2023.  See [here](https://docs.perplexity.ai/docs/getting-started) for a guide on how to set up an API key and get started with `pplx-api` per the documetnation [here](https://docs.perplexity.ai/).  Perplexity regularly update the model support for this API and at the time of writing the latest and greatest supported model is `llama-3.1`.  The following examples assume you have set up the API key in an environment variable called `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`."

       "\n",
       "1. **Evaluate the Gate**:\n",
       "   - Check if the gate is sagging or if the hinges are loose. This can often be fixed by tightening loose screws or replacing damaged hinges [2][4].\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Inspect Hinges and Latches**:\n",
       "   - Look for rust, wear, or missing screws on the hinges and latches. Tighten any loose screws or replace them if necessary [4].\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Adjust Gate Alignment**:\n",
       "   - Use a level to ensure the gate is even. If it's sagging, you might need to realign it using a turnbuckle kit or by adjusting the hinges [2][4].\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Replace Hardware**:\n",
       "   - If the hinges are damaged, purchase new ones. Opt for heavy-duty hinges if your gate is large or heavy [4].\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Reinforce Posts**:\n",
       "   - If the posts supporting the gate are wobbly or leaning, use concrete mix and post levelers to reinforce them [4].\n",
       "\n",
       "### Professional Help\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Call a Fence and Gate Repair Service**:\n",
       "   - If the damage is extensive or you're not comfortable with DIY repairs, consider hiring a professional fence and gate repair service. They can assess the gate and provide a solution that ensures it functions properly and securely [1][5].\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Check Local Reviews**:\n",
       "   - Look for local professionals with good reviews on platforms like Angi to ensure you're hiring someone reliable and skilled [5].\n",
       "\n",
       "### Steps for Professional Repair\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Assessment**:\n",
       "   - The professional will evaluate the gate's condition, including the hinges, latches, and posts.\n",
       "   \n",
       "2. **Repair or Replacement**:\n",
       "   - Depending on the extent of the damage, they may need to replace hinges, latches, or even parts of the gate frame.\n",
       "   \n",
       "3. **Reinstallation**:\n",
       "   - Once the necessary repairs are made, they will reinstall the gate ensuring it swings freely and closes securely.\n",

      "The Milky Way galaxy contains an estimated 100 to 400 billion stars[1][3][6]. This wide range reflects the difficulty in precisely counting stars in our galaxy. Astronomers estimate this number by calculating the galaxy's mass and the percentage of that mass made up of stars[6]. The exact figure depends on factors like the average mass of stars used in calculations and our ability to detect very faint, low-mass stars throughout the galaxy[3][6]. While we can't count each star individually, these estimates give us a sense of the vast scale of our home galaxy.\n",
