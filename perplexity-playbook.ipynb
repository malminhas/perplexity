    "Perplexity is an intelligent search engine with a chatbot sytle interface that leverages popular AI models to offer comprehensive answers to user inquiries.  It is able to search the internet to provide real-time information via a friendly user experience that includes native mobile apps.  The tool is specifically designed to perform as a research companion providing links to underlying source articles unlike ChatGPT in default mode.  Perplexity comes with an OpenAI-compliant API called [`pplx-api`](https://blog.perplexity.ai/blog/introducing-pplx-api) which was introduced in October 2023.  See [here](https://docs.perplexity.ai/docs/getting-started) for a guide on how to set up an API key and get started with `pplx-api` per the documetnation [here](https://docs.perplexity.ai/).  Perplexity regularly update the model support for this API and at the time of writing the latest and greatest supported model is `llama-3.1`.  The following examples assume you have set up the API key in an environment variable called `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`."
