    "Perplexity is an intelligent search engine with a chatbot sytle interface that leverages popular AI models to offer comprehensive answers to user inquiries.  It is able to search the internet to provide real-time information via a friendly user experience that includes native mobile apps.  The tool is specifically designed to perform as a research companion providing links to underlying source articles unlike ChatGPT in default mode.  Perplexity comes with an API called [`pplx-api`](https://blog.perplexity.ai/blog/introducing-pplx-api) which was introduced in October 2023.  See [here](https://docs.perplexity.ai/docs/getting-started) for a guide on how to set up an API key and get started with `pplx-api`.  The following examples assume you have set up the API key in an environment variable called `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`."

       "A broken garden gate that is no longer closing properly is an issue that requires the expertise of a tradesperson specializing in carpentry, specifically in gate repair or installation. Here's a detailed explanation of why this is the case and what you can expect when you call a carpenter to fix the problem.\n",
       "\n",
       "Carpentry is a skilled trade that involves the design, construction, and repair of structures made of wood, as well as other materials like metal and plastic. Carpenters are trained to work with various tools and techniques to create, install, and maintain structures, including doors and gates.\n",
       "\n",
       "When it comes to a garden gate, there are several components that can malfunction, leading to it not closing properly. These components include the hinges, the latch or lock, the posts or frames, and the gate itself.\n",
       "\n",
       "Hinges are the metal fittings that attach the gate to the posts or walls. Over time, hinges can become loose, rusted, or worn out, causing the gate to sag or not close properly. A carpenter can assess the condition of the hinges and either tighten or replace them as needed.\n",
       "\n",
       "The latch or lock is the mechanism that secures the gate when it's closed. If the gate is not closing properly due to a faulty latch or lock, a carpenter can inspect the issue and make any necessary repairs or replacements.\n",
       "\n",
       "The posts or frames that support the gate can also be a source of the problem. If the posts are rotten, uneven, or have shifted, the gate may not close properly. A carpenter can assess the condition of the posts and either repair or replace them as needed.\n",
       "\n",
       "Lastly, the gate itself may be the issue. If the gate is warped, bent, or otherwise damaged, it may not close properly. A carpenter can assess the condition of the gate and either repair or replace it as needed.\n",
       "\n",
       "When you call a carpenter to fix your broken garden gate, they will typically follow these steps:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Inspection: The carpenter will inspect the gate and identify the cause of the problem.\n",
       "2. Quote: Based on the inspection, the carpenter will provide you with a quote for the repairs or replacement.\n",
       "3. Repairs or Replacement: The carpenter will then carry out the repairs or replacement as agreed.\n",
       "4. Testing: Once the repairs or replacement are complete, the carpenter will test the gate to ensure it's closing properly.\n",
       "5. Cleanup: The carpenter will clean up the work area and leave your garden looking neat and tidy.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, if you have a broken garden gate that is no longer closing properly, you should call a carpenter to fix it. Carpenters are trained to assess and repair various components of gates, including hinges, latches, locks, posts, and the gate itself. They will follow a process of inspection, quote, repairs or replacement, testing, and cleanup to ensure your garden gate is functioning properly once again"
