    "Perplexity is an intelligent search engine with a chatbot sytle interface that leverages popular AI models to offer comprehensive answers to user inquiries.  It is able to search the internet to provide real-time information via a friendly user experience that includes native mobile apps.  The tool is specifically designed to perform as a research companion providing links to underlying source articles unlike ChatGPT in default mode.  Perplexity comes with an API called [`pplx-api`](https://blog.perplexity.ai/blog/introducing-pplx-api) which was introduced in October 2023.  See [here](https://docs.perplexity.ai/docs/getting-started) for a guide on how to set up an API key and get started with `pplx-api`.  The following examples assume you have set up the API key in an environment variable called `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`."

       "A broken garden gate that is no longer closing properly is an issue that requires the expertise of a tradesperson specializing in carpentry, specifically in the area of door repair and installation. Here's a detailed explanation of why this is the case:\n",
       "\n",
       "A garden gate is a type of door that provides access to the outdoor space surrounding a property. It is typically made of wood, metal, or a combination of both, and it operates using hinges that attach it to the fence or wall. Over time, due to various factors such as weather conditions, wear and tear, or accidental damage, a garden gate may develop issues that prevent it from closing properly.\n",
       "\n",
       "When a garden gate is not closing correctly, it can be caused by several different problems. For instance, the hinges may have become loose or rusted, the latch or locking mechanism may be faulty, or the frame of the gate may have warped or twisted. In some cases, the problem may be more complex, such as damage to the gatepost or the fence to which the gate is attached.\n",
       "\n",
       "To repair a broken garden gate, a tradesperson with the necessary skills and expertise is required. This tradesperson is typically referred to as a carpenter or a door repair specialist. Carpenters are trained in the art of woodworking and are skilled in the design, construction, and repair of wooden structures, including doors and gates. Door repair specialists, on the other hand, focus specifically on the repair and installation of doors and their associated hardware.\n",
       "\n",
       "The process of repairing a broken garden gate involves several steps. First, the carpenter or door repair specialist will inspect the gate to determine the cause of the problem. They will check the hinges, the latch or locking mechanism, and the frame of the gate for any signs of damage or wear. They may also check the gatepost and the fence to which the gate is attached to ensure that they are in good condition.\n",
       "\n",
       "Once the cause of the problem has been identified, the carpenter or door repair specialist will then proceed to repair or replace the damaged components. For instance, if the hinges are loose, they may be tightened or replaced. If the latch or locking mechanism is faulty, it may be repaired or replaced. If the frame of the gate has warped or twisted, it may be straightened or replaced.\n",
       "\n",
       "In some cases, the damage to the garden gate may be too extensive to be repaired, and a new gate may need to be installed. In this scenario, the carpenter or door repair specialist will measure the opening where the gate is to be installed and provide the customer with options for a new gate that fits the space and meets their budget and aesthetic preferences.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, if you have a broken garden gate that is no longer closing properly, you should call a carpenter or a door repair specialist to fix it. These tradespeople have the necessary skills and expertise to diagnose and repair the problem, ensuring that your garden gate functions correctly once again"
