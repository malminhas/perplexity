    "Perplexity is an intelligent search engine with a chatbot sytle interface that leverages popular AI models to offer comprehensive answers to user inquiries.  It is able to search the internet to provide real-time information via a friendly user experience that includes native mobile apps.  The tool is specifically designed to perform as a research companion providing links to underlying source articles unlike ChatGPT in default mode.  Perplexity comes with an OpenAI-compliant API called [`pplx-api`](https://blog.perplexity.ai/blog/introducing-pplx-api) which was introduced in October 2023.  See [here](https://docs.perplexity.ai/docs/getting-started) for a guide on how to set up an API key and get started with `pplx-api` per the documetnation [here](https://docs.perplexity.ai/).  Perplexity regularly update the model support for this API and at the time of writing the latest and greatest supported model is `llama-3.1`.  The following examples assume you have set up the API key in an environment variable called `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`."

      "The Milky Way galaxy contains approximately 100-400 billion stars[1][3][6]. This estimate is based on calculations of the galaxy's mass and the percentage of that mass made up of stars[6]. However, determining an exact number is challenging due to the difficulty in counting stars individually across such vast distances[3]. The range in estimates stems from uncertainties in factors like the average mass of stars and the total mass of the galaxy[6]. While this number is enormous, it's worth noting that the Milky Way is just one of an estimated 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe[4].0: https://www.astronomy.com/science/astro-for-kids-how-many-stars-are-there-in-space/\n",
