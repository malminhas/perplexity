    "Perplexity is an intelligent search engine with a chatbot sytle interface that leverages popular AI models to offer comprehensive answers to user inquiries.  It is able to search the internet to provide real-time information via a friendly user experience that includes native mobile apps.  The tool is specifically designed to perform as a research companion providing links to underlying source articles unlike ChatGPT in default mode.  Perplexity comes with an API called [`pplx-api`](https://blog.perplexity.ai/blog/introducing-pplx-api) which was introduced in October 2023.  See [here](https://docs.perplexity.ai/docs/getting-started) for a guide on how to set up an API key and get started with `pplx-api`.  The following examples assume you have set up the API key in an environment variable called `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`."

       "\"To fix a broken garden gate, you would typically need to hire the services of a professional tradesperson who specializes in carpentry, gate repair, or fencing. Here's a detailed explanation of the process and the reasons why you might need to call one of these trades:\\n\\n1. Carpenter: A carpenter is a skilled craftsperson who specializes in the design, construction, and repair of wooden structures. They have a deep understanding of various types of wood, joinery techniques, and carpentry tools. If your garden gate is made of wood and has broken hinges, posts, or other structural components, a carpenter would be an excellent choice to repair or replace the damaged parts. They can also help you with any customization or modifications you might want to make to your gate.\\n\\n2. Gate Repair Specialist: A gate repair specialist is a tradesperson who focuses specifically on the repair and maintenance of various types of gates, including automatic gates, sliding gates, and swing gates. They have extensive knowledge of gate mechanisms, such as hinges, latches, and electric operators. If your garden gate is not closing properly due to a faulty latch, damaged hinges, or a malfunctioning electric opener, a gate repair specialist would be the best person to call. They can diagnose the issue, provide a quote for the repair, and complete the work efficiently and effectively.\\n\\n3. Fencing Contractor: A fencing contractor is a professional who specializes in the installation, repair, and maintenance of fences and gates. They have experience working with various materials, such as wood, vinyl, aluminum, and chain link, and can help you with any issues related to your garden gate. If your gate is attached to a fence and the fence has been damaged, a fencing contractor would be able to assess the damage and provide a solution that addresses both the gate and the fence.\\n\\nIn summary, if you have a broken garden gate that is no longer closing properly, you would typically need to call a carpenter, gate repair specialist, or fencing contractor, depending on the nature of the damage and the materials used in the construction of your gate. These tradespeople have the skills and expertise to diagnose the issue, provide a quote for the repair, and complete the work efficiently and effectively\""
